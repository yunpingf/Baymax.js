## Baymax.js

Baymax.js is a little companion for front-end developers. The browser compatibility is a problem in front-end developement. We need an easy to detect whether an attribute or element is supported in a browser. Besides the browser compatibility problem, performance is also an important factor in web applications. HTML5 attributes such as Canvas's performance in different browsers can be evaluated by FPS. Baymax.js includes three parts, the HTML detection, the CSS detection and the performance evaluation. 

The HTML detection detects whether a certain HTML element is supported in a browser. The CSS detection detects whether a CSS attribute or a value of certain attribute is supported in a browser. The performance evaluation now includes the FPS evaluation, which calculates how many frames are rendered in a second.
